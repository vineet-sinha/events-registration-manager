Registration (sing up) extension for 'The Events Calendar'. Let clients sign up and send an automatic confirmation email.

== Description ==

This plugin is an extension for 'The Events Calendar' to receive registrations for events as email.

You can use a shortcode [wpecr_registration_button] to insert a registration (order) button for each event. If clients click the registration button, they get to a registration form (shortcode [wpecr_registration] for the form page witht the slug '/registration'), where they can insert their personal data. After the registration is completed, the client and yourself receive a confirmation email for the event registration with payment details.

The confirmation email text for the event registration can be customized on the plugins settings page in the wordpress admin.

Requirements: 'The Events Calendar' plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) is already installed and activated.
